ðŸšŒ Bus Ticket Booking Terminals (Python Project)

Just built a Bus Ticket Booking Terminal using Python! ðŸš€
This project simulates a ticket counter experience where users can:

Select departure and destination points

Calculate total fare

Generate a ticket with travel details


The goal was to practice Python fundamentals like loops, conditionals, and functions, while designing a simple terminal-based booking system.

Excited to keep improving it by adding seat availability, payment options, and multiple passenger bookings in the future! ðŸ”¥
